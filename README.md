# Resume Builder
This is a project set up for building and maintaining an online resume, but it can be used to build a simple online presence of any kind. Your project is stored locally, and is specific to your url. (Eg. If you append `/page1`, to the url it will open a new storage session to save your page.)

**_NOTE:_**  Storage is limited in the browser, so it is highly recommended to regularly export your project to avoid losing progress. 

The resume is build using Grapesjs, as well as the following plugins:

- grapesjs-plugin-scroll
- grapesjs-plugin-chartjs
- grapesjs-tui-image-editor
- grapesjs-blocks-basic
- grapesjs-blocks-flexbox
- grapesjs-plugin-export
- grapesjs-navbar
- grapesjs-component-countdown
- grapesjs-plugin-forms
- grapesjs-tabs

## Future Development
- ~~Plugin for configuring scroll animations~~
- Plugin for creating charts.js elements - WIP
- Server-side storage (to avoid storage limit)
- Basic user/password authentication for saving data
- Plugin to show elements based on user input (for dynamic forms)
- Server application for publishing and collecting data
